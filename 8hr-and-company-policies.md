# E-Commerce Team Code of Conduct

## Team Communication

- Be on time for meetings, or let other team members know beforehand if you’re going to be late.
- When going on (unusual) breaks, please update your status on Slack—especially when working from home.
- On Slack, we try to keep a clean and structured style of communication.
- Let relevant team members know before going on vacation, and prepare a structured handover beforehand.

## Working Hours Regulation

- We generally have flexible working hours. Nevertheless, it is not possible for members of the team to start work before 7 a.m. or to finish before 3:30 p.m. in a 40-hour week.
- One member of each sub-team needs to be available until at least 5:00 p.m.
- If you have to leave before 3:30 p.m. in a 40-hour week, you have to take half a vacation day.
- Only exception: on Fridays we can leave a bit earlier, if the following conditions are met:
  - You have ensured you worked 40 hours (or according to your contract) that week already, deducting all breaks.
  - One member of your sub-team is available until 4:30 p.m.
- According to German labor law, a break of at least 30 minutes must be taken when working for more than 6 hours.
- Please start tracking your working hours via Personio—under “time tracking.”

## Home Office Regulation

- You have the flexibility to work from home.
- If you plan to work from home somewhere other than your place of residence, let your supervisor know in advance and make sure that your internet connection is sufficient.
- Working from the airport, train, etc. is not considered home office unless it’s a work-related trip.
